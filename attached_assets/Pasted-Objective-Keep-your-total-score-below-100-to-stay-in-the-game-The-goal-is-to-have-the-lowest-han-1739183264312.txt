Objective:
Keep your total score below 100 to stay in the game.
The goal is to have the lowest hand score during rounds, while avoiding penalties if you call "Show."
Setup:
Use a standard 52-card deck (no Jokers).
Deal 4 cards to each player.
Place the remaining cards face down to form the draw pile.
Flip the top card from the draw pile to start the discard pile.
Card Values:
Ace: 1 point
Number cards (2–10): Face value
Jack: 11 points
Queen: 12 points
Red King (:hearts::diamonds:): 13 points
Black King (:spades::clubs:): 0 points
Gameplay Rules:
Turn Sequence:
On your turn:
Discard a card (or multiple cards, if eligible).
Draw a card (either from the draw pile or the top card of the discard pile).
Discarding Rules:
You can discard a single card OR multiple cards if one of the following conditions is met:
Pair Rule: You have two cards of the same number (e.g., 7:spades: and 7:diamonds:).
Sequence Rule: You have a sequence of at least 3 cards in the same suit (e.g., 5:hearts:, 6:hearts:, 7:hearts:).
The sequence must be in numerical order (Aces count as 1).
Discarding multiple cards reduces your total score faster and frees up space for better cards.
Calling "Show":
You can call "Show" to end the round only if your hand's total score is 5 or less.
The round immediately ends when "Show" is called.
Show Outcome:
All players reveal their hands.
If the player who called "Show" has the lowest hand score, they are awarded 0 points for the round.
The other players’ scores are calculated and added to their total.
If any other player has a lower score than the player who called "Show," the player who called "Show" is penalized with 30 points, added to their total score.
Drawing and Discarding Dynamics:
Players may draw the top card from the draw pile or take the top card from the discard pile to improve their hand.
Strategic discards (like high-value cards or cards that might complete opponents' sequences) are key to managing your score and blocking others.
Winning the Game:
The game continues until one or more players reach 100 points.
The player with the lowest total score when the game ends is the winner.
Examples of Discarding Multiple Cards:
Pair Rule:
Hand: 8:spades:, 8:diamonds:, 5:clubs:, 3:hearts:
You can discard both 8:spades: and 8:diamonds: together because they’re the same number.
Sequence Rule:
Hand: 3:spades:, 4:spades:, 5:spades:, 9:diamonds:
You can discard 3:spades:, 4:spades:, and 5:spades: together because they form a sequence of the same suit.
Combining Rules:
You can discard one pair or one sequence per turn, not both at once.
Strategic Tips:
Call "Show" Wisely:
Only call "Show" if you’re confident your score is the lowest. Misjudging can lead to a costly 30-point penalty.
Manage High Cards:
Discard high-value cards like Red Kings, Queens, and Jacks early to keep your hand score low.
Use Sequences and Pairs:
Try to form sequences or pairs to discard multiple cards and reduce your hand size faster.
Pay Attention to the Discard Pile:
Watch which cards your opponents pick up to guess their strategy and block their sequences.
